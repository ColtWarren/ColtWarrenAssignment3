This Java console application simulates a user login system
using credentials stored in a CVS file. It validates username
(case-insensitive) and password (case-sensitive) against a 
data.txt file. Allows 5 login attempts before locking the user out.
Implements a User POJO and a UserService class for data handling
and validation. It reads user data from data.txt, creating an array 
of User objects for authentication. To run the application, input 
credentials via the console, and receive immediate feedback on login
success or failure, including account lockout after 5 failed attempts!
This was a fun one to figure out. I learned how to use 
non-static classes, static methods, primitive Arrays, and how to "Get" Java!
'Thank you!'
